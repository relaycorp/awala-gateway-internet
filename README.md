# Relaynet-Internet Gateway

This is the reference implementation of a Relaynet-Internet Gateway, a type of _public gateway_ whose responsibility is to connect private gateways to the Internet. As such, it implements the following Relaynet bindings:

- [PoWeb](https://specs.relaynet.network/RS-016), to exchange parcels with private gateways via the Internet.
- [CogRPC](https://specs.relaynet.network/RS-008), to exchange parcels with private gateways via an end-to-end encrypted sneakernet.
- [PoHTTP](https://specs.relaynet.network/RS-007), to receive parcels from other gateways or public endpoints.

For more information, please refer to the [online documentation](https://docs.relaycorp.tech/relaynet-internet-gateway/).
