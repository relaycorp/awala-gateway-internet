# Install and upgrade

The Relaynet-Internet Gateway is distributed as a [Helm chart](https://github.com/relaycorp/relaynet-internet-gateway-chart). Please refer to its documentation to learn how to install and upgrade the chart.

Note that deploying the Docker images directly is discouraged: We're likely to change paths, as well as split and rename the Docker image.
